CHANGING MEDIA
1. remove old media
2. put in new media

would need:
whole part that touches the cells needs to be autoclavable
special cap (vented)
two reservoirs (old media and new media)
pump (or two) to remove old media completely and put new media
housing that is smooth and can be sprayed with ethanol

extra things: bluetooth control + app
camera to verify everything is ok (or to look at cells)
ice pack with insulation for new media (release and heat up + temperature sensor)
